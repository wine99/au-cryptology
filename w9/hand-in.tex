\section*{CPA security of El Gamal}

The adversary $Adv$ plays the CPA game, which means that it has the public keys
$G$, $\alpha$, and $\alpha^a$. It then chooses a message $m$ and sends to the oracle,
and gets back $(\alpha^r, x)$. Let $G$, $\alpha$, $\alpha^a$, $\alpha^r$, and $x\cdot m^{-1}$ be
the inputs to $B$, namely $G$, $\alpha$, $\alpha^a$, $\alpha^b$, and $\alpha^c$. So $r=b$.
Then notice that $x$ is either $\alpha^{ab}\cdot m$ when we are in the real world,
or $\alpha^{ab}\cdot s$, for some random $s$, when we are in the ideal world. We can rewrite
$\alpha^{ab} \cdot s = \alpha^{ab} \cdot m \cdot \alpha^{t} = \alpha^{abt} \cdot m$.
Because $s$ is uniformly random, $abt$ is also uniformly random. This means that the oracle
is either responding with $\alpha^{ab}\cdot m$ or $\alpha^{c}\cdot m$, for a uniformly random $c$.
The adversary $Adv$ can distinguish between these two cases with advantage $\epsilon$, which means
that it can guess whether $c = ab$ or $c$ is random with advantage
$\epsilon$. Hence we simply let $B$ output the same as $Adv$ does and $B$ has $\epsilon$ advantage
in playing the DDH game.
